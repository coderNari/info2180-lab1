        <p> I am 22 years old. I love oranges and coffee. My favourite colour is pink. After completing my Computer Science degree,
            I plan to venture into Entrprenuership, Web, App Development and Data Science. Surfing the internet and seeing different
            webpages but specifically Apple's, has fuelled my interest in Web Development as I would want to be a developer behind 
            incredible websites like that. This is the beginning and I am looking forward to learning a lot from this course.  </p>
